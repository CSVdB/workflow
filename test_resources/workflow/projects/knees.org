* Knees

I want to get serious about my knees so that they can finally start healing correctly.

I'll have to start doing a bunch of exercises with rigorous discipline.


** NEXT figure out which exercises I need/can do, give them all a name.
- The stomp
- Squatt
** TODO build a workout plan with just these exercises.
It does not need to be hard-core, but I do need it.
