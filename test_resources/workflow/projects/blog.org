* Blog
I'd like to start writing again, maybe not every week like before, but every month should be possible.
I'd like to start it again with 12 posts in backlog.
They need to be divided into timeless posts and time-specific posts.
Then the time-specific posts can be posted sooner

*** TODO The problem with total constructors                                                                                                                                                               
Blog: the problem with constructors: they are rarely total                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                              
There needs to be a distinction between setting the values and finishing the creation. There must be room for failure.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                              
Haskell does this well with smart constructors, but the community doesnt do it very well.                                                                                                     
Ironically, java does it very well if checked exceptions are used.
